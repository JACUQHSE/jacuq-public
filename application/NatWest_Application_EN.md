# 1. About the Business  
JACUQ® is a leadership‑oriented HSE and ESG consultancy that helps **professionals, teams, and organisations** design and operate **safe, ethical, digitally‑enabled and sustainable work systems**.

Our philosophy integrates:
- the **holonic–fractal paradigm** (scalable leadership model)  
- the **Triple Bottom Line (3E: Economy–Environment–Equity)**  
- 20+ years of international experience across construction, healthcare, manufacturing, engineering and complex project environments [1](https://onceprevent-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jacuna_jacuq_com/Documents/Microsoft%20Copilot%20Chat%20Files/Juan%20Acun%CC%83a%20%E2%80%93%20HSE%20consulting%202026.pdf)  

Through this perspective, JACUQ® supports organisations that want to **lead responsibly**, move beyond reactive compliance, and create work ecosystems that empower people, reduce friction, and support long‑term responsible growth.

We operate in the UK, Spain and Colombia.

# 2. The Problem  
Organisations often lack:
- **human‑centred practices** that protect and support people  
- **clear, usable systems** (workflows, documentation, evidence)  
- **responsible decision‑making frameworks** (ESG/ASG)  
- models that scale across **person → micro‑team → project → organisation**

Most systems are reactive, fragmented or bureaucratic.  
This creates operational risk, people‑related harm, behavioural drift, and a lack of clarity for leaders.

# 3. The Solution (HUMAN · SMART · EVOLVE)  
JACUQ® delivers a unified leadership model built around three service domains:

### **HUMAN — People, Wellbeing & Safety Leadership**
Supporting wellbeing, psychological safety, ergonomics (PVD/DSE) and ethical boundaries.  
Based on the founder’s expertise in human‑centred safety and behavioural systems. [2](https://onceprevent-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jacuna_jacuq_com/Documents/Microsoft%20Copilot%20Chat%20Files/Profile%20(7).pdf).pdf)

### **SMART — Systems, Processes & Digital Enablement**
Building real workflows, documentation governance, M365/Power Platform/Azure‑based processes, and decision‑ready evidence.  
Grounded in holonic‑fractal systems thinking. [2](https://onceprevent-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jacuna_jacuq_com/Documents/Microsoft%20Copilot%20Chat%20Files/Profile%20(7).pdf).pdf)

### **EVOLVE — Sustainability & Organisational Maturity**
Integrating ASG/ESSG/ESG, ethical operations, long‑term thinking and organisational resilience.  
Inspired by the founder’s academic research in sustainable HSEQ models (3E). [1](https://onceprevent-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jacuna_jacuq_com/Documents/Microsoft%20Copilot%20Chat%20Files/Juan%20Acun%CC%83a%20%E2%80%93%20HSE%20consulting%202026.pdf)

These three domains allow organisations to **scale leadership and responsibility**, regardless of industry or size.
