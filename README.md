## 🧭 The JACUQ® Philosophy  
My work is grounded in:

- The **holonic–fractal paradigm** (person → micro‑team → project → organisation)  
- The **Triple Bottom Line (3E: Economy – Environment – Equity)** as a foundation for responsible growth  
- My academic research in **integrated HSEQ systems and sustainability**, University of Seville  
- A professional belief that **leadership, safety, performance and responsibility are inseparable**
