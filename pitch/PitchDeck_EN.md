# JACUQ® — Pitch Deck (Public Version)
### Strategic HSE & ESG Leadership for People, Systems and Responsible Organisations  
**Juan Acuña — Founder & CEO · JACUQ LTD (London, UK)**

# 1. The Problem  
Most organisations struggle to build work systems that are:
- human‑centred  
- digitally clear  
- ethically responsible  
- sustainable in the long term

Common symptoms:
- Reactive compliance and fragmented documentation  
- Overload, confusion, poor boundaries  
- Underdeveloped leadership in HSE/ESG  
- Systems that do not scale across teams, projects or locations

---

# 2. The Opportunity  
Organisations of all sizes need:
- People‑centred systems that protect and empower  
- Digital clarity (real workflows, usable documentation, decision‑ready evidence)  
- ESG/ASG practices with measurable impact  
- Leadership frameworks that scale holonically (person → micro‑team → project → organisation)

This is where **JACUQ®** adds value.

---

# 3. What JACUQ® Does  
We help organisations lead responsibly across **HSE (Health, Safety, Environment)** and **ESG/ASG** through a unified, leadership‑oriented approach.

Our work integrates:
- The **holonic–fractal paradigm** (scalable leadership model)  
- The **Triple Bottom Line (3E)**: Economy · Environment · Equity  
- 20+ years of multi‑industry HSE experience  

---

# 4. The Philosophy Behind JACUQ®  
JACUQ® is inspired by:
- **Holonic–fractal thinking** (systems within systems)  
- **3E (Economy–Environment–Equity)** as a base for responsible operations  
- Research in integrated HSEQ management (Master’s thesis)  
- Practical experience in complex real environments (UK, Spain, Colombia)  

This philosophy becomes operational through **three leadership domains**:
